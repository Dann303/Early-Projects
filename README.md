# Early-Projects
This is where and when it all started...

These are some of the projects I attempted creating during high school using visual basic as a language... The biggest was the sudoku game, back then I haven't heard yet of anything called a GUI so I attempted creating a nice interface using just the console, print line by line and taking care of all spaces.
